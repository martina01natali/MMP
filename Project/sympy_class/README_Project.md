# Project

The routine could be built like this:
- compute everything in sympy
- take everything to numpy
- vectorize
- plot


## Goals

## ToDos
- [ ] build fourier sine and cosine basis
- [ ] build method to compute fourier coefficients
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

## Issues
- [ ] catch errors of non-existing symbols and make the code make them
- [ ] implement substitution of **params inside subs by making params in a proper form 
- [x] find a nice way to build the fourier basis
- [x] check f_coeff
