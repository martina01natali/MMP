# README for folder Codes_2020-21

The python codes stored in this folder are the reviewed and polished
versions of the original codes provided by prof. Drago during the course
of Mathematical Methods for Physics (LM Physics) during the a.a. 2020-21.

The original codes can be found in the subfolder Originals.

Most codes are correctly reviewed and commented.
The names of the codes refer to the name of the book example on which
they are built. All the reference examples can be found on the book of
Gockenbach [1].
Any error found in the codes is the author's responsibility only.

For best visualization, the user is encouraged to open the .py files
with the spyder GUI, to ensure correct reading of the files' cells division
(marked with #%% or # %%).
