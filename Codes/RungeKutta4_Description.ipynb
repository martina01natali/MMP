You integrate the function f(t) from a starting point a to an ending point b. The approximate value that you get is the value of the function at the starting point multiplied by the lenght (b-a). To make it work well, we divide the range [a:b] into linearly spaced intervals and evaluate the integral for each step. The iteration of the evaluation for each step leads to a small integral. The final integral is made by the summation of all the small integrals.\r\n","\r\n","$ \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} f(x)dx \\approx hf(x_0) + hf(x_1) + \\ldots + hf(x_{n-2})  $\r\n","\r\n","We may define a new function that operates the Euler method.
